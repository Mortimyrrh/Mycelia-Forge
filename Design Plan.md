# Mycelia 1.16.4

## Planed Implamentation  
  
### Mycelia Network (Dimension) (started)
- Super flat world.
- New custom blocks.
- A few decorative structures. 
- Relative cords of 64:1.
- Negative effect (Mycelial Decay) applied to the player. 
- Considering using a https://github.com/fogleman/physarum sim to grow networks for teleportation (probably a v2 idea)

### Mycelial Decay (Effect) (working outside the network)
- A damaging effect applied to the player when in the network.  
  
### Mycelial Defence (Effect) (working i think)
- Reduces negative effects of mycelial decay.  
  
### Mycelial Stew (Item - Food) (working)
- A hearty stew with magical benefits. 
- Briefly applies Mycelial Defence effect.  
  
### Ancient Armour (Item - Armour) (started, but probably a v2)
Permanently applies Mycelial Defence effect.
- Upgraded armour could allow the player to teleport between worlds at will?
- can be repaired with nethrite scrap to create netherplate armour
  
### Mycelial Afinaty (Enchantment) (not started may rethink crafting)
- Craftable with an enchanting table using, a few levels above lv15, a book, and a piece of Ancient Armour (consumed by enchantment).
- Can be added to any armour using an anvil to give the player immunity to Mycelial Defence.
