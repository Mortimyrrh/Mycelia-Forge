# Mycelia 1.16.4
Forge
  
## Main Goal
- To add a lightweight, super flat dimension for travelling a long distance.  
  
To achieve this, there will be various ways of teleporting in and out of the dimension using items, portals and Endermen. In the same way, every one block travelled in the nether is 8 blocks in the Overworld. Once in the Mycelial Network Dimension, the relative coordinates are 64 blocks to 1. This allows players to travel more distance faster.
